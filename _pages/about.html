<p>Yet another video game blog. Maintained by some person on the internet with opinions. Probably lives in a basement.
<p>This blog serves as a repository for miscellaneous shower thoughts I have relating to game design. I generally don't write about current events or the latest releases, because I'm usually not caught up with them. If I write about specific titles, they'll most likely be older ones.
<p>The source for this site can be found <a href="https://github.com/underwaterlevel/underwaterlevel">here</a>.
