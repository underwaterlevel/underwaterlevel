<p>Yet another video game blog. Maintained by some person on the internet with opinions. Probably lives in a basement.
<p>This blog primarily serves as a repository of miscellaneous shower thoughts relating to game design. If any specific games are referenced, they will probably be older ones. I generally don't comment on current events or the latest releases, because I'm usually not caught up on them.
